# notes

Currently, GameMaker does not support vibration on Mac, Linux, or mobile devices. It may be possible to provide partial support through Steam Input. YellowAfterlife has a related extension.

Windows 8 and below do not have proper support for left and right vibration on certain gamepads and trying to set these separately can cause issues. As such, for these OSes, Vibration mixes left and right vibration into the right motor. It may be possible via extension to pick out these specific devices (Xbox One)
